# Lotto-Insights
This repo holds the code for the Lotto-Isnights-Web-App. Lotto-Insights allows you to query "German" Lotto Jackpots since 1955. In fact, you can enter 6+ number from 1-49 in the UI and the application searches for a potential jackpot with the given numbers since 1955. In case, you have a hit, the app dispays the jackpot date, the winning numbers, and the potetial jackpot in Euro.

## [>> Final Application](https://lotto-insights.de "Lotto-Insights App")

#### The project is for educational purposes: 
- Get a feeling how difficult it actually is to crack the Lotto-Jackpot
- Get familiar Firebase-Hosting
- Get familiar Google Domains


#### Static Webpage:
The entire application is written in Javascript & HTML. The static app is than hosted on Firebase, hence cached on SSD and served via a global CDN with SSL certification. Firebase is a backend as a service that allows you to build and run a production app at scale. Lastly, I got myself a custom domain from #Google #Domains that redirects to the Firebase application.
